# CropTracker

Objective
To develop an optimization tool that maximizes daily crop profits in Stardew Valley by selecting the most profitable crops based on season, growth time, and budget constraints.

Overview
The project implements a profit optimization algorithm inspired by the Knapsack problem. It dynamically calculates the optimal combination of crops to plant for maximum profit while considering real-world farming constraints such as:
Available money
Crop growth times
Seasonal restrictions

Key Features
Profit Optimization Algorithm: Calculates the most profitable crops for each season.

Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit, allowing users to input constraints and view crop recommendations and profit breakdowns.

Dynamic Visualizations: Provides intuitive visual outputs of crop performance and profit margins.

Impact
Increased daily crop profits by 60%, from 300 gold to 480 gold per day.
Enhanced decision-making for Stardew Valley players, saving time and effort on manual crop selection.
Demonstrated expertise in Python, data analysis, and dynamic programming techniques.

Technical Details
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Streamlit
Techniques: Dynamic programming, data cleaning, and visualization

Future Enhancements
Expand to include livestock and artisan goods optimization.
Add multi-season planning for long-term profit maximization.
